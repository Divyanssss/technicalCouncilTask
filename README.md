# College Noticeboard

A simple college noticeboard application where students and clubs can post and view events happening on campus.

## What it does

This application acts as a centralized digital bulletin board for the entire college community. It enables students and clubs to easily share and discover information about campus events, workshops, sports meets, cultural festivals, and important announcements. By providing a single platform for posting and viewing notices, it ensures that crucial updates and opportunities donâ€™t get lost in scattered WhatsApp groups or fleeting social media stories. Each event post includes all the essential detailsâ€”such as the eventâ€™s purpose, date, time, location, category, and contact informationâ€”making it simple for everyone to stay informed and engaged with campus life
